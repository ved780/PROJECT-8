VPN Usage and Privacy Report

Internship Task: 8 – Understand and Use a VPN for Privacy and Secure Communication
Intern Name: Ved Vyas
Date: 15/08/2025

1. Introduction
The objective of this task was to set up and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to understand its role in protecting online privacy and securing communication. This included installing a VPN client, connecting to a secure server, verifying changes in IP address, and exploring encryption and privacy features.

2. VPN Setup Steps

1. Selected VPN Provider: Cloudflare VPN (WARP)
2. Signed Up: Created a free account through the Cloudflare WARP app.
3. Downloaded and Installed Client: Installed the official "1.1.1.1 with WARP" application for my operating system.
4. Connected to Server: Enabled WARP mode to encrypt traffic and route through Cloudflare’s secure network.
5. Verified IP Change: Used whatismyipaddress.com to confirm the IP location had changed from my original.
6. Tested Encrypted Connection: Accessed several websites and confirmed the traffic was routed through Cloudflare’s servers.
7. Disconnected and Compared: Measured browsing speed and IP address before and after using Cloudflare VPN.

3. Observations

Test Stage            | IP Location       | Speed       | Encryption Active  | Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before VPN            | Vadodara/ India   | [129 Mbps]  | No                 | Original ISP IP
Connected to VPN      | Dhaka/Bangladesh  | [70 Mbps]   | Yes                | Encrypted tunnel via Cloudflare
After Disconnecting   | Vadodara/ India   | [129 Mbps]  | No                 | Returned to original IP

4. VPN Benefits Identified
- Hides real IP address and location.
- Encrypts internet traffic to prevent interception.
- Protects privacy on public Wi-Fi networks.
- Routes traffic through Cloudflare’s global network for low latency.

5. VPN Limitations Noted
- May reduce browsing speed depending on server load.
- Does not provide full anonymity (Cloudflare still processes traffic).
- Free plan lacks advanced server location choices.

6. Understanding VPN Encryption
Cloudflare VPN uses modern encryption protocols such as Wire Guard to ensure secure, low-latency connections. This keeps data between my device and Cloudflare’s servers unreadable to third parties, including ISPs and public Wi-Fi attackers.

7. Conclusion
This task showed that Cloudflare VPN (WARP) is a fast and reliable privacy tool. While it doesn’t offer complete anonymity, it significantly improves security on public networks and prevents most forms of traffic interception.
