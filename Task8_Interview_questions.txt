Cybersecurity Internship – Task 8
Interview Questions & Answers

What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure service that encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a remote server, hiding your real IP address and helping protect your privacy online.

How does a VPN protect privacy?
It masks your IP address and encrypts data between your device and the VPN server, preventing ISPs, public Wi-Fi snoopers, or hackers from seeing your online activity.

Difference between VPN and proxy?

VPN: Encrypts all internet traffic from your device and changes your IP.

Proxy: Only routes specific app or browser traffic without encryption.

What is encryption in VPN?
Encryption converts readable data into an unreadable format using algorithms and keys, ensuring only authorized parties can read the information being transmitted.

Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?
No. A VPN hides your IP and encrypts traffic, but your activity can still be tracked by the VPN provider, websites, or if you log into personal accounts.

What protocols do VPNs use?
Common VPN protocols include WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, and L2TP/IPSec. These define how data is encrypted and transmitted.

What are some VPN limitations?

Possible speed reduction due to encryption overhead.

Limited features or locations on free plans.

Trust is required in the VPN provider’s logging policy.

Cannot protect against all forms of tracking (e.g., cookies, fingerprinting).

How does a VPN affect network speed?
Encryption and rerouting through a VPN server can cause a small to moderate speed drop, depending on server distance, network congestion, and the VPN’s infrastructure.
